			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Subject</h2>
					<p>The subject of this lab is being able to structure files in HTML and link to different files within a file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose was that when I imported my portrait and linked it in the file, it wouldn't load in the page. I eventually realized that I had linked to the incorrect image folder, and added a "../" to backtrack up the file structure and access the correct folder. </p>
