					<p>Pseudocode for Rock-Paper-Scissors:</p>
					<pre class="code"><code>
//Assign players to either designations "Player 1" or "Player 2"
//When round starts, provide 3 available inputs (rock, paper, scissors) for the first player
//Prompt them to select an input
//After both players have selected an input, decide if a player has reached a winning instance
  //Winning instances: (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock)
//If both players play the same input, the round is a draw, and no one gets points. The round starts over
//The player that has reached the winning instance gets a point
//First player to reach two points wins the game
